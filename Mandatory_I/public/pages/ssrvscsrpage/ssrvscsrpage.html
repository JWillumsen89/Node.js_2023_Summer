        <div class="window-main-description">SSR or Server Side Rendering is a technique that renders the page on the
            server and sends the HTML to the client. The client then renders the page and displays it to the user.

            CSR or Client Side Rendering is a technique that renders the page on the client. The client then renders the
            page and displays it to the user.

        <div class="content toc-subsection">
            <div class="window-sub-title" id="sub-title-1-1">SSR - Server Side Rendering</div>
            <div class="window-description">
                This happens on the server, the server renders the page and sends the HTML to the client. The client
                then renders the page and displays it to the user. It's recognized by web crawlers and search engines,
                which makes it useful for SEO. It's also useful for the first page load, because the user doesn't have
                to wait for the page to load before seeing the content. The downside is that it's slower than CSR,
                because the server has to render the page and send the HTML to the client.

                Here the client renders the page and displays it to the user. It's faster than SSR, because the server
