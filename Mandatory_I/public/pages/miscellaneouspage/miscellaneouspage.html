            changes
            and work with other developers on the same project. It is a very useful tool that you will need to learn
            how to
            use. In this section we will go through the basics of Git and how to use it in the terminal.

    #To commit your changes run the following command
    git commit -m "Your commit message"

    #Link your local repository to your remote repository by running the following command
    git remote add origin your-repo-url.git

    #To push your changes to your repository for the first time run the following command
    git push -u origin main

    #After that you can just run the following command to push your changes to your repository
    git push

    #You can also pull the latest changes from your repository by running the following command
